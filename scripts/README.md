Scripts exploiting the functionality of polnet module.

* **csv**: manipulating output CSV files with the particles (or motifs) lists
* **templates**: scripts for preprocessing input templates for macromolecules.
* **data_gen**: scripts for synthetic data generation
  * The script **all_features.py** can generate tomograms with all structural features available. It is set up to generate 
    a dataset with all different types of structures including membranes, microtubules, actin networks, 18 different 
    cytosolic and 8 membrane-bound macromolecules. Input configuration files for geometry and transformation generators, 
    as well as the macromolecular models are available under **data** folder.
